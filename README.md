# multinomial_naive_bayes_
This project uses inbuilt sklearn.naive_bayes.MultinomialNB classifier as well as the algorithm code from the scratch which is having accuracy even more than inbuilt classifier  
In this we there was a dataset with 20 categories cosnist of documents related to that category first the given dataset was coverted into dataset which can we readable and can be used for the algorithm in matrix format of m*n 
In which first features are made for which go through ecah and every document from the given categories then made a dictonory with words and there count 
then only first 2000 words were used as a feature it can be understood from the graph that words after 2000 having very low frequencies therefore they would not have that significatnt impact on our prediction model

Then rest the function were made for fit for predict for probability

comments are there in the code one can read the rest from there
